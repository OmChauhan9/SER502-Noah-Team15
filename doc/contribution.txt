# Contribution Documentation for NOAH Language Project

## Team Members

Aksh Rajesh Chauhan

- Contributions Made:
  - Defined the initial grammar rules for the NOAH language.
  - Developed regular expressions for token definitions and key language constructs.
  - Assisted in testing and debugging the lexer.

- Future Plans:
  - Refine grammar and token definitions based on parser testing feedback.
  - Work on optimizing the lexer for better performance.

Om Rajesh Chauhan

- Contributions Made:
  - Set up ANTLR and configured it for generating lexer and parser.
  - Created Java classes to integrate lexer and parser with the compiler.
  - Built the initial parser logic to process the NOAH syntax tree.

- Future Plans:

  - Implement additional grammar features as the project evolves.

Nisarg Hemalkumar Desai

- Contributions Made:
  - Designed and wrote sample NOAH programs to test all language constructs (variables, operators, loops, etc.).
  - Verified parser accuracy by running sample programs and checking output.
  - Drafted grammar and language design documentation for the NOAH_Grammar.pdf.

- Future Plans:
  - Expand test coverage with more complex sample programs.
  - Support team members in refining the grammar and parser logic.

Harsh Sanjay Gohel

- Contributions Made:
  - Wrote and updated the README.md file, including build and run instructions.
  - Managed the GitHub repository structure and organization.
  - Scheduled and coordinated team meetings, ensuring smooth collaboration.

- Future Plans:
